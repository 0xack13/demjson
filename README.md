demjson
=======

<b>demjson</b> is a Python language module for encoding and decoding
and syntax-checking JSON data.

It attempts to be as closely conforming to the JSON specification,
published as [IETF RFC 4627](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt), as
possible.  It can also be used in a non-strict mode where it is much
closer to the JavaScript/ECMAScript syntax (published as ECMA 262).
The demjson module has full Unicode support and can deal with very
large numbers.

It also comes with a <b>jsonlint</b> tool which can be used to
validate your JSON documents for strict conformance to the
RFC specification; as well as to reformat them, either by
re-indenting or for minimal/canonical JSON output.
