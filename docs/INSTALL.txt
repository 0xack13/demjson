Installing demjson

Basic installation
==================

This software is published in the Python Package Index (PYPI),
at <http://pypi.python.org/>, which may make it easy to install.
If your system has either "pip" or "easy_install", then you may
try one of the following commands to install this module:

   pip install demjson
   pip-python install demjson
   easy_install demjson

Otherwise, you can install it by downloading the distrubtion and
unpacking it in some temporary directory.  Then inside that
directory, type:

    python setup.py install

Optionally, for a minimal installation, you can also just copy the
"demjson.py" file into your own project's directory.


jsonlint command
================

The installation should have installed the script file "jsonlint".

If it did not, you can simply copy the file "jsonlint" to any
directory in your executable PATH, such as into /usr/local/bin under
Unix/Linux.  Make sure the script is set as being executable, and if
needed adjust the first "#!" line to point to your python interpreter.


Running self tests
==================

Self tests are included which conform to the Python unittest
framework.  To run these tests, do

    cd test
    PYTHONPATH=.. python test_demjson.py
