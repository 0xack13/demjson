Using callback hooks in demjson
===============================

Starting with demjson release 2.0 it is possible to hook into the
encoding and decoding engine to transform values.  There are a set of
hooks available to use during JSON decoding and another set of hooks
to use during encoding.

    Decoding Hooks         Encoding Hooks
    decode_string          encode_value
    decode_float           encode_dict
    decode_number          encode_dict_key
    decode_array           encode_sequence
    decode_object          encode_bytes
                           encode_default

Although hooks can be quite powerful, they are not necessarily
suitable for every situation.  You may need to perform some complex
transformations outside of demjson.
